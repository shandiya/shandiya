## Shandiya Balasubramaniam

Hello!

I'm a data analyst at the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au), where I work on 
projects that align with [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) data principles. 
In a former life I was a conservation biologist. When I'm not coding for work or looking at birds, I 
sometimes make [art with R](https://github.com/shandiya/variations-on-a-theme).
